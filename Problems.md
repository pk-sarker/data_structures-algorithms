#### Validate Binary Search Tree
*Problem:*\
Given a binary tree, check if the tree is a valid binary search tree(BST).

The Binary Search Tree has the following properties: 
* Each node is represented by a Key, numeric type
* Each node may be at max two child, left and right
* The left subtree of a node(A) contains the nodes which are less than parent node(A)
* The right subtree of a node(A) contains the nodes which are greater than parent node(A)
* Both left and right subtrees must be binary search tree
