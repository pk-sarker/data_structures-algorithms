# Linked List
Linked list is a linear data structure when the memory allocation of the elements in the linked list is not contiguous. 
Each element or `node` in the linked list will have memory allocation based on availability. Each element will contain memory reference of the next node.

## Single Linked list
```
First Node          2nd Node          3rd Node         4th Node
     |                 |                 |                 |
     |                 |                 |                 |
+----+------+     +----+------+     +----+------+     +----+------+
| 5  |   o------->| 3  |   o------->|  1 |   o------->| 4  | null |
+----+------+     +----+------+     +----+------+     +----+------+
```



## Double Linked list
```
First Node          2nd Node          3rd Node         4th Node
     |                 |                 |                 |
     |                 |                 |                 |
             +--------------+    +--------------+     +--------------+
             |              |    |              |     |              |
+----+----+----+     +----+----+----+    +----+----+----+    +----+----+----+
|null| 5  |    |     |    | 3  |    |    |    |  1 |    |    |    | 4  |null|
+----+----+----+     +----+----+----+    +----+----+----+    +----+----+----+
       |               |     |              |    |              |
       +---------------+     +--------------+    +--------------+
